\begin{definition}[Direct Image]
    \lean{Verdier.direct_image}
    Let $f : X \ra Y$ be a continuous map.
    For sheaf $\mathscr{F} : Sh (X)$,
    the direct image $f_* \mathscr{F} : Sh (Y)$
    of $\mathscr{F}$
    is defined by
    \begin{equation}
        f_* \mathscr{F} (U) := \mathscr{F} (f^{-1} (U))
    \end{equation}
    for any open $U \subset Y$.
\end{definition}
